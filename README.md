# Loan-Approval-Hypothesis-Testing
- Determined appropriate statistical tests in R among independent and paired t-tests, ANOVA, repeated
measures ANOVA, Chi-Square, and Mann-Whitney U tests, to analyze factors influencing loan approval.
- Assessed assumptions for statistical tests, including normality (Shapiro-Wilk test), homogeneity of variance
(Levene’s test), sphericity (Mauchly’s test), and outlier detection.
- Performed data wrangling and visualized results in ggplot2, identifying significant predictors for loan approval.
