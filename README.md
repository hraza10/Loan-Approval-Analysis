# Loan-Approval-Analysis
Analyzed factors influencing loan approval using R, applying statistical tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Square. Assessed assumptions like normality and variance, and visualized findings with ggplot2 to identify significant predictors for loan approval. Data wrangling and hypothesis testing were key components of the project.
